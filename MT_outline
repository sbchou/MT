Of lurkers, <blank>, and <blank>


before diving into big data, look at individual intent: look at how people actually use social networks (hint: there's no one answer)

Cut to the meat of the argument *within the first non-intro paragraph*.


OUTLINE:
1) intro, open with christian vs sasha
2) the mission of FB is to ___ . but in fact, most users bend social networks to cater to their needs, picking and choosing the parts that suit them best.
	-- this is often dependent on their careers and age.
3) this is a general trend, and we see it in the way people use privacy settings: they'd rather reshape existing structure (pick and choose parts) to their need rather than just adjust the existing structure (you can cite the voyeur article by danah for similiar creative limitations re: privacy)
- people are very creative: although we all see the same set of features, it's like handing someone a toolbox: what sort of thing they make of it vastly differs
4) data analysis doesn't pick this sort of user intent up. It maligns people who aren't posters/content producers (all we see are gaps-- but in fact the silence is very nuanced)
5) it also don't take into account this exquisite corpse view
-social networks are fluid--most people view their activity across networks as a whole, and use different networks for different actions
6) this is why FB cannabilizing (snapchat/insta/whatsapp etc) is interesting, because it means that it is gaining a larger and larger slice of the pie. 
--but this also means that in order for them to thrive, the communities must remain small enough to be personable



-of lurkers/and posters, voyeurs and flanuers
--not everyone is a creator on social media, and audiences can stitched across many platforms: big data analysis inheritely biased

esp "the other is that people have interesting/unique individual ways they use social media for their specific purposes which means that "big data" analysis etc is inheritely biased without knowing these intents"


from metadata, we can know that sasha is a phd student, and christian worked at google. we can also deduce that both rarely post items, 

but in looking at one part of data, we might exclude other aspects (for example they both post little, but for sasha this is because he prefers to read about others' opinions; for christian, this is because he would ideally use FB as a chat client; sasha is not interested in networking; christian is)

-we see only gaps in data; these gaps hold infinite, complex, important motives



What are takeaways from interviewing?
-I found that most people didn't have an audience in mind at all; not everyone was a sharer on each network, and if they shared, they shared on some but not others (exquisite corpse)
-People rarely use Facebook in intended ways
-individuals adapt facebook usage to their liking, usually dependent on career
-they will often delegate various aspects of social networking to different media (liz uses instagram for food photos; christian uses foursquare for small 
business aspect)

--> people are very creative! They will almost always reshape existing structure (pick and choose parts) to their need rather than just adjust the existing structure (you can cite the voyeur article by danah for similiar creative limitations re: privacy)

Possible thesi:
-before diving into big data, look at individual intent
--people distribute their sharing across many networks; and others share not at all
-social networks die when diluted; constantly changing shape and form by nature (they are after all natural human networks); cannabilism (of snapchat) leads to dilution and death, unless those indivual ecosystems remain intact
-people pick and choose their favorite aspects across various social networks: exquisite corpse
--data analysis on a single dataset provides an incomplete image of what the user is actually like (only what they behave like on that one network) therefore a flawed and limited view if for example predicting things like political views



me:  okay
i think i might write it on that, since the background reading i have most supports that
is it a correct assumption, though?
for example, like i interviewed two people, both of whom don't reallypost on facebook
one guy is just by nature an observer
and likes reading people's reposts/shares
which meant he migrated easily to twitter
and then the other guy, who also doesn't post
just wants to use FB sort of like a profile
 Vivek:  yeah
 it's really interesting
but also
 me:  so his ideal use case, he turns off everything expect a nice profile and chat
 Vivek:  you should interview people who do write to fb
 me:  i have :)
 Vivek:  oh ok
 me:  but like the argument is that
looking at the data, you'd really have no idea what their ideal usages/purpose is, since both are like CS people, both don't post much
 Vivek:  yeah
 me:  but the psychology is really different
 Vivek:  right
 me:  weeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
  Vivek:  well
you could also take a sample across networks right? but yeah there's not enough data present in a lack of activity
the gaps are pretty apparent
 me:  what do you mean by "the gaps are pretty apparent"
 Vivek:  like
gaps in knowledge
 me:  gotcha
like the lack of data makes us group them all the same
when in fact there are so many different underlying motives
that marketers/scientists don't catch at all
