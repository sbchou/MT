before diving into big data, look at individual intent

Like most twenty-two-year-old college students, Christian Moscardi is on Facebook every day. Yet by looking at his wall, you'd never know it-- Christian hardly ever posts content; neither statuses nor photos interest him. "Maybe on the very rare occasion, where I'd think: wow I want all of my friends to see this right now", he pondered. 

For Christian, Facebook is not at all about consuming and sharing social media. Instead, it's a convinient way to reach all of his friends and colleagues. Communication-- via messages and chat-- is the feature he most values. Ideally, he'd "block everything", save for a "nice profile pic", and use his account exclusively for the messaging and networking aspects.

Twenty-eight-year-old Ph.D. student Sasha Rush also owns a Facebook profile that he rarely posts on. Unlike Christian, although he uses messaging sometimes, he has no special affinity towards it. Before he began to pursue his doctorate, Sasha was in fact an employee of Facebook as an engineer. Yet even during that time, when he had a "critical mass" of colleagues and friends, he contributed very little activity himself. 

When pressed to explain why, he grins sheepishly: "I'm a lurker", he admits. "I've always been". Uninterested in both photos and statuses, Sasha uses Facebook primarily as a way to keep track of his friends' intellectual and cultural interests through their posted articles and shares. Lately, he's been migrating towards Twitter, where reading is encouraged and easier to do. 

Facebook states that its mission is "to give people the power to share and make the world more open and connected" (cite). But in reality, not every person is a sharer, and those who do share are encouraged by different motives and means. Given the same set of tools, users are surprising innovators, picking and choosing the features that suit them best. Because of network externalities, migrating to another platform is often unappealing-- instead, people tend to creatively limit existing structures.

Social media scholar danah boyd reported on a similiar phenomenon in the way that Facebook users, specifically teens, retained sense of privacy. Instead of simply adjusting the settings to block certain friends, users tended to develop unique, innovative strategies in posting and sharing-- everything from self-censorship to account deactivation. Social networks create a sort of surveillance state, and under surveillance, people begin to develop methods to manage realities in which they are observed, leading to this innovation. (CITE) The same theory can be extrapolated to people's differing usages of Facebook at large, not just in their methods of privacy.



This becomes an issue in big data
big data/growing

but assuming authenticity/blind user flawed
