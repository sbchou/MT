[Title Here]
before diving into big data, look at individual intent

Like most twenty-two-year-old college students, Christian Moscardi is on Facebook every day. Yet by looking at his wall, you'd never know it-- Christian hardly ever posts content; neither statuses nor photos interest him. "Maybe on the very rare occasion, where I'd think: wow I want all of my friends to see this right now", he pondered. 

For Christian, Facebook is not at all about consuming and sharing social media. Instead, it's a convinient way to reach all of his friends and colleagues. Communication-- via messages and chat-- is the feature he most values. Ideally, he'd "block everything", save for a "nice profile pic", and use his account exclusively for the messaging and networking aspects.

Twenty-eight-year-old Ph.D. student Sasha Rush also owns a Facebook profile that he rarely posts on. Unlike Christian, although he uses messaging sometimes, he has no special affinity towards it. Before he began to pursue his doctorate, Sasha was in fact an employee of Facebook as an engineer. Yet even during that time, when he had a "critical mass" of colleagues and friends, he contributed very little activity himself. When pressed to explain why, he grins sheepishly: "I'm a lurker", he admits. "I've always been". Uninterested in photos and statuses, Sasha uses Facebook primarily as a way to keep track of his friends' intellectual and cultural interests through their posted articles and shares. Lately, he's been migrating towards Twitter, where reading is encouraged and easier to do.
